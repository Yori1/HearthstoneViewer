                    I made this portfolio to collect all of my work from my semester of Smart Mobile in a single place.

                    In the first 4 weeks, I'm attending workshops about Progressive Web Apps and UX design.
                    For every day of Smart Mobile, I'll write a summary of the work I've done and what I took away from
                    the workshops.

                    Workshop PWA1
                </div>
                <p>
                    On the first day, I attended the workshop PWA1. I made a simple app with an index.html and the
                    javascript to add the worker and the manifest, to successfully deploy my first PWA-app and install
                    it on my phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was interested in making a more maintainable PWA, and so I looked into combining PWA with Angular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using the npm angular/pwa package I managed to add the ServiceWorker module to my Angular
                    application, allowing me to deploy and install my Angular application as a PWA.
                </p>

                    Personal research

                <p>
                    I decided to start working on my own PWA, I thought of an app that allows the user to view Hearthstone cards, save them lists on their
                     phone, and possibly talk to others about aspects of the cards. I found an API that would allow me to build that, so I looked into 
                     caching data from http calls using the Angular ServiceWorker module.
